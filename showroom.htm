        <h3 class="description">Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) <br>
            BEVs are also known as All-Electric Vehicles (AEV). Electric Vehicles using BEV technology run entirely on a battery-powered electric drivetrain. <br> The electricity used to drive the vehicle is stored in a large battery pack which can be charged <br> by plugging into the electricity grid. The charged battery pack then provides power to one or more electric motors to run the electric car.

        <h3 class="description">Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)<br>
            HEVs are also known as series hybrid or parallel hybrid. HEVs have both engine and electric motor. The engine gets energy from fuel, and the motor gets electricity from batteries. The transmission is rotated simultaneously by both engine and electric motor. This then drives the wheels.
